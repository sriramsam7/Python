# Python
A simple Tic-tac-toe game in Python where the user plays against the computer. The computer plays with X's and the user plays with O's.
The computer always starts its move at the center of the board. The user can select the position for their move.
I have utilized the randrange() function which draws a random integer for the computer's move.
You can try the code and check how you fared against the computer.
Good Luck!
